# Credit Risk Modelling

## Description

This project focuses on building a predictive model to assess the credit risk associated with loan applicants. By analyzing various features of applicants, the model aims to classify the likelihood of default, thereby assisting financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection

- **Dataset**: The project utilizes the `credit_risk_dataset.csv`, which contains information on loan applicants, including features such as age, income, loan amount, and credit history.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and addressed missing data to ensure model accuracy.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converted categorical features into numerical representations suitable for modeling.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numerical features to improve model performance.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Visualization**: Created plots to understand the distribution of features and the relationship between variables.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Assessed correlations between features to identify potential multicollinearity.

### 4. Model Building

- **Algorithm Selection**: Implemented machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, to predict credit risk.
- **Model Training**: Trained models using the processed dataset.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model parameters to enhance predictive performance.

### 5. Model Evaluation

- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Validation**: Performed cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
